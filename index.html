            <div class="page-content">
                One sunny morning, Baby Helen and Baby Juliet met for their very first playdate. 
                
                Helen had curly brown hair and a bright yellow dress. Juliet wore a blue bow and giggled when she saw Helen.
                
                "Hello!" said Helen, offering her favorite teddy bear.
                
                "Hi!" replied Juliet with a smile that showed her tiny teeth.
                
                They began to play together, and just like that, they became the best of friends!

            <div class="page-content">
                On a bright spring day, Helen and Juliet visited a beautiful garden filled with flowers of every color.
                
                "Look!" Helen pointed as a butterfly with blue wings landed on a pink flower.
                
                Juliet clapped her tiny hands with joy. Another butterfly, orange and black, fluttered around her head like a dancing ribbon.
                
                The babies watched with wide eyes as butterflies danced among the blooming flowers, their wings sparkling in the sunshine.

            <div class="page-content">
                "Would you like some tea?" asked Helen, carefully holding a tiny plastic teapot.
                
                "Yes, please!" Juliet nodded, sitting her stuffed bunny at the table.
                
                The babies arranged their favorite toys around a small table covered with a flowery cloth. Mr. Bear, Miss Elephant, and Fluffy Bunny all got special seats.
                
                Helen poured pretend tea into colorful cups while Juliet shared pretend cookies. They giggled as they sipped from empty cups, pinkies raised just like grown-ups!

            <div class="page-content">
                "Puppies!" squealed Helen when they visited the pet store.
                
                "Kitties!" Juliet pointed with excitement.
                
                The babies pressed their noses against the glass, watching puppies tumble and play. Kittens chased toy mice and batted at dangling feathers.
                
                A small black-and-white kitten with bright green eyes came right up to them. It put its tiny paw on the glass where Juliet's hand was.
                
                "Meow," said the kitten.
                
                "Meow," Juliet answered back, making both babies dissolve into giggles.

            <div class="page-title">Swinging High</div>
            <div class="page-content">
                At the playground, Helen and Juliet couldn't wait to try the swings.
                
                "Higher!" Helen laughed as her mommy pushed her gently.
                
                "Wheee!" Juliet kicked her little legs in the air.
                
                Back and forth they swung, feeling the breeze in their hair. It was like flying, they thought, high up in the sky like birds.
                
                The babies laughed and laughed as they swung together, making this the perfect end to their wonderful day of adventures.
